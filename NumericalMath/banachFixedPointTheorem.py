@description: The banach fixed point theorem guarantees the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of certain self-maps 
of metric spaces, and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points.The banach function in this script checks 
if a certain function is self-imaging and / or contractive and calculates the constant alpha which represents the largest 
possible slope of the handed over function on the interval [a,b]
