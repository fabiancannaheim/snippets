# Resources

The purpose of this repository is to collect code snippets for **algorithms**, **data structures**, **design patterns**, **math** and **programming in general** which I learned over the years. Some code is inspired by university lectures, others were created just for fun. Hopefully these snippets will help in the future to be more efficient when facing similar problems.

Feel free to use whatever you may need.
